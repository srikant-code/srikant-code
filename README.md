**Please note** 

You may think that these number of contributions I made are so less, you should have 2k-3k contibutions a year. 
<br/>Or you may also think that OMG thats a lot of contributions which I have made in a year. 

<br/>Whatever you think, I just want to make it clear that I literally don't care what you think. 
<br/>Instead what I care is the quality of commits which I made, and not the number of 1 liner commits like others which doesn't even makes sense. 
<br/>I know what impact I have done with my code. 

<br/>Incase you want to know too just contact me on any social platform, I am happy to share my ideologies with you.

To clarify, I have another company Github account as well ([@srikant-sahoo-maersk](https://github.com/srikant-sahoo-maersk)). The contributions in that account don't show up here for obvious reasons because Github don't have a link multiple accounts option :(
But still, you can refer the below the screenshots of my contibutions in the other account, incase that account gets disabled when I switch companies in future.
